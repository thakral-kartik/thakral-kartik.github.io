I am a graduating Ph.D. student and PMRF Fellow at the [Image Analysis and Biometrics (IAB) Lab](https://iab-rubric.org/), IIT Jodhpur, under the supervision of [Prof. Richa Singh](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/) and [Prof. Mayank Vatsa](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~mvatsa/). I have also had the opportunity to collaborate closely with [Tal Hassner](https://talhassner.github.io/home/) and [Tamar Glaser](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=phl57rQAAAAJ&hl=en). My research is dedicated to developing frameworks for trustworthy and reliable AI systems, with a particular emphasis on machine unlearning, media forensics, and the security and privacy of deep learning models. Specifically, I focus on advancing techniques for handling images, videos, and multimodal data to enable robust, AI-driven solutions for sensitive and high-stakes applications.

My work has been published in premier conferences such as CVPR, ICLR, ICML, ECCV, and Interspeech, as well as leading journals including Pattern Recognition (PR), Nature Machine Intelligence (NMI), IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science (T-BIOM), and IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (TAI). I have also presented my research at workshops in CVPR and ICLR, contributing to the evolving discourse on responsible AI.

Before beginning my doctoral studies, I was an undergraduate researcher under [Prof. Ankush Mittal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Z5HoCIAAAAJ&hl=en), working on medical imaging and author-style understanding. During this time, I also collaborated with [Gaurav Bhatt](https://gauravbh1010tt.github.io/) and [Prof. Rahul Nijhawan](https://csed.thapar.edu/facultydetails/MTU3NA==).
